            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
            <h3>How is this different from Facebook groups?</h3>
            <p>Facebook groups are great for discussion, but they're not designed for career development and skills matching. The Burner Profile system lets you specify your goals and get contacted for opportunities that advance your involvement, rather than hoping you see the right post at the right time.</p>

            <h3>What if I'm not sure what I want to do?</h3>
            <p>That's perfect! The system includes career development questions to help you explore different areas of interest. You can start with small roles and gradually discover what excites you most.</p>

            <h3>Will this replace personal connections?</h3>
            <p>Not at all! The goal is to supplement personal networks, not replace them. Many of the best opportunities still come through relationships, but this system ensures those relationships can form based on shared interests and complementary skills.</p>

            <h3>What about privacy and data security?</h3>
            <p>Your privacy is our top priority. You control exactly which events can see your information and contact you. We follow Australian privacy laws and maintain transparent governance through Community Data Stewards.</p>
